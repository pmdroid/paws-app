# Enroll a remote Linux runner

Enrollment connects a Linux host to your Paws workspace. Claude and Codex run as the non-root `paws-runner` user. Install the languages, browsers and other tools your repositories need on the VM. Each task receives its own workspace. Run the host commands over SSH on the VM. Paws gives you one command with a single-use token to run on the VM.

To have Paws make and enroll an exe.dev VM for you, including on a Paws reachable only on Tailscale, see [Create a runner VM on exe.dev](create-vm.md).

## Prepare Paws and the host

Set up [HTTPS workspace access](workspace-access.md) on the Paws machine and sign in as a workspace admin. The first workspace is created when a Linear workspace administrator authorizes Paws.

Initialize the runner authority once on the Paws machine, using the same Paws home as its service:

```sh
bun run paws runner-authority init
```

Add `PAWS_RUNNER_HOST` with the interface address Paws should listen on and `PAWS_RUNNER_PORT=8788` to the HTTPS service's environment, then restart Paws. On Tailscale, use the Paws machine's Tailscale IP as the listener address and its Tailscale DNS hostname in the HTTPS URLs below.

Paws stores transcripts locally by default in `~/.paws/runner-transcripts` with owner-only directory and file permissions. With a custom `PAWS_HOME`, it uses that home's `runner-transcripts` directory. With runner HTTPS and GitHub App access configured, Paws sends agent work to enrolled hosts and keeps their transcripts on the Paws machine.

To use S3, pipe a JSON object containing `bucket`, `endpoint` (HTTPS), `region`, `accessKeyId`, `secretAccessKey`, and optionally `sessionToken` into `bun run paws runner-storage configure` using the same Paws home as its service, then restart Paws. Settings are encrypted in the protected secrets directory. New transcripts and agent session snapshots go to S3; existing local transcripts and snapshots in `~/.paws/agent-sessions` remain readable. Snapshot chunks are encrypted by Paws before upload, and the key stays in `~/.paws/secrets`. To select local storage again, configure `{"kind":"local"}` and restart Paws.

The VM needs outbound access to both endpoints. The default ports are TCP 8787 for dashboard access and HTTPS enrollment, and TCP 8788 for the daemon's mTLS connection. Use the ports configured by your Paws operator. Both URLs must have a valid server certificate for their hostname.

Install the runner on the VM:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://get.paws.boo | sudo sh
```

The installer selects the AMD64 or ARM64 package from the latest GitHub release, checks its SHA-256, and installs it. The package creates the service accounts, verifier identity, runtime and systemd units. Pass a version to install that release:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://get.paws.boo | sudo sh -s -- 1.2.3
```

Package contents and upgrade behavior are in `deploy/linux`: the release manifest, the signed package builder, and the installer.

## Configure the runner

On the VM, replace the example hostname and repository names, then create the protected configuration:

```sh
sudo install -o root -g paws-runner -m 0640 /dev/stdin /etc/paws-runner/config.json <<'JSON'
{
  "controlPlaneUrl": "https://paws.example.com:8787",
  "runnerApiUrl": "https://paws.example.com:8788",
  "allowedRepositories": ["your-org/your-repo"],
  "concurrency": 2
}
JSON
```

`controlPlaneUrl` is the dashboard's HTTPS origin. `runnerApiUrl` is the same control plane's runner listener. Each URL contains only the scheme, hostname and optional port. `allowedRepositories` lists the exact GitHub `owner/repository` names this host may execute.

`concurrency` sets the most simultaneous tasks this host accepts, from 1 to 16, and defaults to 2. Each task has its own private workspace. The value is the host's ceiling: change it in `/etc/paws-runner/config.json` and restart `paws-runner.service` to apply it. Below that ceiling, workspace admins set the runner's concurrency on its runner page. Paws returns that value in the heartbeat reply and the runner applies it to new work right away, with no restart. Lowering it does not stop running work; the runner takes no new work until it is under the new limit. The runner reports its ceiling and its applied value with each authenticated heartbeat. Runner releases from before this change ignore the setting and keep their config value. Pull request merges remain serialized.

For a private server certificate authority, add `serverCa` containing its PEM certificate text as a JSON string. Certificates issued by a publicly trusted authority use the default trust store.

Check dashboard connectivity from the VM:

```sh
curl --fail https://paws.example.com:8787/health
```

For a private CA, also pass `--cacert /path/to/server-ca.pem` to curl. The response includes `"ok":true`. The daemon receives its client certificate when it enrolls and uses it on the runner listener.

## Sign in to the agents

Run the login command for each provider you intend to use on this host. The daemon runs the agent as this same account, with provider state under `/var/lib/paws-agent`:

```sh
sudo /usr/sbin/runuser --user paws-runner -- /usr/bin/env -i --chdir=/var/lib/paws-agent HOME=/var/lib/paws-agent PATH=/opt/paws-runner/bin:/usr/bin:/bin LANG=C /opt/paws-runner/bin/claude auth login
sudo /usr/sbin/runuser --user paws-runner -- /usr/bin/env -i --chdir=/var/lib/paws-agent HOME=/var/lib/paws-agent PATH=/opt/paws-runner/bin:/usr/bin:/bin LANG=C /opt/paws-runner/bin/codex login --device-auth
```

Follow the provider's browser instructions. Provider credentials stay in `/var/lib/paws-agent` on the VM.

## Add the host

1. Open your Paws dashboard at `https://paws.example.com:8787/status/runners` and sign in. Any workspace member can add a host and owns the runner it adds.
2. Select **Add a runner**, enter the name you want to see in Paws, and select **Create command**.
3. Copy the command and run it on the VM. It installs the runner, writes `/etc/paws-runner/config.json` for this Paws, stores a single-use enrollment token in a root-owned mode 0600 file, enrolls, and starts `paws-runner.service`.

The token expires after ten minutes and works once. The runner appears under **Runners**, owned by you, as soon as the command prints `"paired":true`. Running the command again on an enrolled host changes nothing. If the token expires, create a new command.

To enroll by hand, write the token to a root-owned mode 0600 file and run:

```sh
sudo /opt/paws-runner/bin/paws-runner runner enroll \
  --config /etc/paws-runner/config.json --name my-runner \
  --token-file /etc/paws-runner/enrollment-token
```

The command starts as root to read the token, then continues as `paws-runner`. The token never appears on the command line.

## Start the daemon and check health

On the VM:

```sh
sudo systemctl enable --now paws-runner.service
sudo systemctl status paws-runner.service --no-pager
```

In **Runners**, select **Refresh runners**, then **View health** for the new host. Choose an agent and run **Check sign-in**, followed by **Check connection**. Connection checks call the selected agent, so use a provider account you have signed in to. The host's heartbeat updates **Last seen**, and the check receipts appear below the form.

For daemon errors, inspect its journal on the VM:

```sh
sudo journalctl -u paws-runner.service -n 100 --no-pager
```

## Working through a Paws outage

Runner 0.1.55 keeps a running agent working when Paws cannot be reached. Deploy the
Paws lease-credit support before upgrading runners. The heartbeat advertises a
30-minute offline budget, capped by the command's remaining active-work time.
The runner counts monotonic awake time spent working. Sleep, wall-clock jumps,
questions waiting for an answer and finished work waiting for delivery do not
spend that budget. Paws's maximum credited lease still caps local authority; if
that deadline passes while idle, the runner stops and retains a failure for
delivery. Helper commands retain their signed deadlines.

A heartbeat that answers without the run's lease, or explicitly fences it, stops
the worker immediately. Connection errors, timeouts and server errors allow work
to continue within the offline budget. Events remain local until delivery can
resume. Successful results ready for delivery and failures produced by the runner
stay in its execution journal until Paws accepts them, including across a runner
restart. Pending results remain in heartbeat reports until delivered. A permanent
result or grant refusal ends retries and keeps the result locally for diagnosis.
Uploads cannot reject a result. Delivery renews expiring grants, retains transient
session-upload progress, and backs off repeated failures up to one minute.
Retries use the same execution and command identifiers, so Paws can
recognize a repeated delivery if its acknowledgement was lost.
